## üìã Basic Usage

### Simple Text Prompt

```lua
selections:prompt("What's your name?", function(name)
    selections:write("Hello, " .. name)
end)

    {"Row 1", "Row 2", "Row 3"},
    {
        {"A", "B", "C"},
        {"D", "E", "F"},
        {"G", "H", "I"}
    },
    function(choice)
        selections:write("You picked: " .. choice)
    end
)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Output Warning

Because `lua-selections` **uses a refresh system that clears and redraws the screen**, you **must use**:

```lua
selections:write("Text here")
```

**Do not use** `print()` or `io.write()` ‚Äî they will be wiped on refresh.

```lua
selections:write(selections.color("Hello in red", "red"))
```

Supported colors:

```
black, red, green, yellow, blue,
magenta, cyan, white,
pink, orange, brightBlue
```

    optionsY?,    -- table of vertical options (rows)

    callback      -- function(selectedName)
